    <p>Today is Day 2 of the DCSI camp. So far I have had a great time at the camp.
      I really like all of my classes so far. The only problem I have is that the days
      for me are very long. Last night i got home at ten! But I think it is worth it so far.
      So far I have started to make a game in Unity, and I've made a few interactive systems
      with a program called Max.
